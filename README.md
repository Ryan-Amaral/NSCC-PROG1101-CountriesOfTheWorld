A project for my intro to programming class at NSCC. It is a list of all (I hope) countries on earth. When a country is clicked, its population, area, population density, and percentage of the world population shows up. The data is obtained from a text file, and there is a folder with all of the flags. The population can be updated for each country, just to show that it is a bit interactive. I feel that this is a nice concise application with a simple appealing layout.
